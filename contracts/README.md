## Foundry

**Foundry is a blazing fast, portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust.**

Foundry consists of:

-   **Forge**: Ethereum testing framework (like Truffle, Hardhat and DappTools).
-   **Cast**: Swiss army knife for interacting with EVM smart contracts, sending transactions and getting chain data.
-   **Anvil**: Local Ethereum node, akin to Ganache, Hardhat Network.
-   **Chisel**: Fast, utilitarian, and verbose solidity REPL.

## QuikDB Deployment & Validation

### Prerequisites

```shell
yarn install
```

Create a `.env` file with your deployment configuration:
```shell
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
RPC_URL=https://rpc.sepolia-api.lisk.com  # For Lisk Sepolia testnet
```

### Deployment Scripts

Deploy QuikDB smart contracts using the modern TypeScript deployment controller with **CREATE2 deterministic addresses**:

#### Lisk Testnet Deployment
```shell
yarn deploy:lsk:testnet       # Deploy to Lisk Sepolia testnet
```

#### Lisk Mainnet Deployment  
```shell
yarn deploy:lsk:mainnet       # Deploy to Lisk mainnet
```

#### Local/Simulation Deployment
```shell
yarn deploy:complete          # Local simulation (no broadcast)
```

### üîí Deterministic Addresses (CREATE2)

All contracts are deployed using **CREATE2** with a fixed salt (`keccak256("QuikDB.v1.2025")`), ensuring:
- ‚úÖ **Same addresses across all networks** (testnet, mainnet, etc.)
- ‚úÖ **Predictable addresses** before deployment
- ‚úÖ **Easy integration** for frontend/SDK (hardcode addresses)
- ‚úÖ **Multi-chain compatibility** for future expansion

### CREATE2 Deterministic Deployment

QuikDB uses CREATE2 for deterministic contract addresses, providing:

**üéØ Predictable Addresses:**
- Same contract addresses across all networks (testnet/mainnet)
- Addresses can be calculated before deployment
- Simplified multi-chain integration

**üîß Developer Benefits:**
- Frontend/SDK can use hardcoded addresses
- No need to update addresses between networks
- Easier testing and validation workflows

**üåê Multi-Chain Ready:**
- Deploy to any EVM-compatible network with identical addresses
- Consistent addresses enable seamless cross-chain operations
- Professional deployment standard

**Salt Used:** `keccak256("QuikDB.v1.2025")`

### Validation Scripts

After deployment, validate the contracts are working correctly:

#### Lisk Testnet Validation
```shell
yarn validate:lsk:testnet     # Validate deployment on Lisk Sepolia
```

#### Lisk Mainnet Validation
```shell
yarn validate:lsk:mainnet     # Validate deployment on Lisk mainnet
```

#### Generic Validation
```shell
yarn validate                 # Shows available validation options
```

### Deployment Output

All deployments automatically:
- ‚úÖ Save contract addresses to `deployments/addresses.json` (historical record)
- ‚úÖ Save latest deployment to `deployments/latest.json` (current deployment)
- ‚úÖ Create deployment logs with full transaction details
- ‚úÖ Show deployment summary with all contract addresses
- ‚úÖ Configure access control and proxy setup
- ‚úÖ Provide blockchain explorer links for verification

### Validation Features

The validation script performs comprehensive testing:
- ‚úÖ **Contract Connectivity** - Verifies all contracts are responsive
- ‚úÖ **Node Operations** - Tests node registration, status updates, and listing
- ‚úÖ **User Operations** - Tests user registration and profile management
- ‚úÖ **Facade Operations** - Tests main contract interface and delegation
- ‚úÖ **Access Control** - Verifies role-based permissions
- ‚úÖ **Data Integrity** - Checks cross-contract consistency
- ‚úÖ **Cleanup & Safety** - Handles existing test data gracefully
- ‚úÖ **Blockchain Explorer Links** - Provides verification links for all contracts

### Upgrade Features

The upgrade system provides seamless contract updates:
- ‚úÖ **Proxy Addresses Preserved** - Users continue using the same addresses
- ‚úÖ **Data Integrity** - All storage contracts and data remain unchanged
- ‚úÖ **Zero Downtime** - Upgrades happen atomically
- ‚úÖ **Version Tracking** - All upgrades are logged in `deployments/upgrades.json`
- ‚úÖ **Rollback Support** - Previous implementations can be restored if needed
- ‚úÖ **CREATE2 New Implementations** - Deterministic addresses for new logic contracts

**Upgrade Process:**
1. Deploy new implementation contracts with incremented salt
2. Upgrade all proxies to point to new implementations
3. Verify upgrades completed successfully
4. Update deployment records with new implementation addresses

**What gets upgraded:** Logic contracts (NodeLogic, UserLogic, ResourceLogic, Facade)
**What stays the same:** Proxy addresses, storage contracts, all user data

### Blockchain Explorer Integration

After deployment and validation, you'll receive direct links to verify contracts on:
- **Lisk Sepolia**: https://sepolia-blockscout.lisk.com
- **Lisk Mainnet**: https://blockscout.lisk.com

Links include:
- All deployed contract addresses
- Deployer address with transaction history
- Test data for validation verification

### Main Contract Addresses

After deployment, use the **proxy addresses** for your applications:
- **QuikFacade Proxy** - Main entry point for the QuikDB system
- **QuikNodeLogic Proxy** - Node management interface
- **QuikUserLogic Proxy** - User management interface  
- **QuikResourceLogic Proxy** - Resource management interface

See `deployments/latest.json` for the complete list of deployed contract addresses.

### Architecture

The QuikDB system uses a modern proxy-based architecture:

**Storage Layer:**
- `NodeStorage` - Node data and metadata
- `UserStorage` - User profiles and authentication
- `ResourceStorage` - Resource allocation tracking

**Logic Layer (Upgradeable Proxies):**
- `NodeLogic` - Node management operations
- `UserLogic` - User management operations  
- `ResourceLogic` - Resource management operations
- `Facade` - Main entry point and unified interface

**Infrastructure:**
- `ProxyAdmin` - Proxy upgrade management
- **CREATE2 deterministic deployment** - Same addresses across networks
- Direct, reliable deployment with TypeScript controller
- Comprehensive validation with real contract operations

### CREATE2 Salt Configuration

The deployment uses a fixed salt: `keccak256("QuikDB.v1.2025")` for:
- Storage contracts (NodeStorage, UserStorage, ResourceStorage)
- Logic implementations (NodeLogic, UserLogic, ResourceLogic, Facade)
- ProxyAdmin

Proxy contracts use derived salts to avoid collisions:
- `keccak256(abi.encodePacked(SALT, "NodeLogicProxy"))`
- `keccak256(abi.encodePacked(SALT, "UserLogicProxy"))`
- `keccak256(abi.encodePacked(SALT, "ResourceLogicProxy"))`
- `keccak256(abi.encodePacked(SALT, "FacadeProxy"))`

### Upgrade Scripts

Upgrade QuikDB logic contracts while preserving proxy addresses:

#### Lisk Testnet Upgrade
```shell
yarn upgrade:lsk:testnet      # Upgrade logic contracts on Lisk Sepolia
```

#### Lisk Mainnet Upgrade
```shell
yarn upgrade:lsk:mainnet      # Upgrade logic contracts on Lisk mainnet
```

#### Local/Simulation Upgrade
```shell
yarn upgrade                  # Local upgrade simulation (no broadcast)
```
